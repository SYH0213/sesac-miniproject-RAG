1. Introduction
Wepresentourlatestfamilyofnativelymultimodalmodelswithadvancedreasoningthroughthinking,
long context and tool-use capabilities: Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash and our earlier Gemini 2.0
Flash and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite models. Together these form a new family of highly-capable models
representing our next generation of AI models, designed to power a new era of agentic systems.
BuildinguponthefoundationoftheGemini1.5series(GeminiTeam,2024),thisGemini2.Xgeneration
brings us closer to the vision of a universal AI assistant (Hassabis, 2025).
TheGemini2.Xseriesareallbuilttobenativelymultimodal,supportinglongcontextinputsof>1
million tokens and have native tool use support. This allows them to comprehend vast datasets and
handle complex problems from different information sources, including text, audio, images, video
andevenentirecoderepositories. Theseextensivecapabilitiescanalsobecombinedtobuildcomplex
agentic systems, as happened in the case of Gemini Plays Pokémon1 (Zhang, 2025). Different models
in the series have different strengths and capabilities: (1) Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most intelligent
thinking model, exhibiting strong reasoning and code capabilities. It excels at producing interactive
web applications, is capable of codebase-level understanding and also exhibits emergent multimodal
coding abilities. (2) Gemini 2.5 Flash is our hybrid reasoning model with a controllable thinking
budget, and is useful for most complex tasks while also controlling the tradeoff between quality, cost,
and latency. (3) Gemini 2.0 Flash is our fast and cost-efficient non-thinking model for everyday tasks
and (4) Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite is our fastest and most cost-efficient model, built for at-scale usage. A
full comparison of the models in the Gemini 2.X model family is provided in Table 1. Taken together,
the Gemini 2.X family of models cover the whole Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, shifting
it forward across a large variety of core capabilities, applications and use-cases, see Figure 1.
The Gemini 2.5 family of models maintain robust safety metrics while improving dramatically on
